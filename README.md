# Autoencoder

## Overview 

The aim of this project was to develop an autoencoder (a type of unsupervised neural network) to perform lossy image compression. The model was trained on a dataset of ~1200 images with dimensions 150 x 225 (x3 for RGB channels).

## Structure 

1. Encoder: Compresses the input image into a lower-dimensional latent representation.
2. Latent space (Bottleneck): This is the compressed representation of the input.
3. Decoder: Reconstructs the original input from the latent space, with some information lost.
